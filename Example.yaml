# Example YAML document.

#Block style example:
---
host: phl-42
datacentre:
  location: &PHL Philadelphia
  cab: !!str 12     # !!str forces the datatype to be string (!! can be used to force other datatypes aswell)
  cab_unit: !!str 3
roles: &wphost
  - webserver
  - wp_database
downtime_sch: |     # The pipe will keep the spaces between the lines (e.g. make sure they are seperated and not on the same line).
  2018-10-31 - Kernel upgrade
  2019-02-02 - security fix
coments: >          # The angled bracket will remove the line spaces, making all the text below one line (commonly used to make it more readable for humans). Double indentation can be applied for a second line.
  Experiancing high I/O
  Since 2018-10-01.
  Currently Investigating.

host: phl-43
datacentre:
  location: *PHL # This pulls the anchor from line 7.
  cab: !!str 12 # !!str forces the datatype to be string (!! can be used to force other datatypes aswell)
  cab_unit: !!str 3
roles: *wphost # Pulls the anchor from line 10, it will still be formatted as a list.




# Simple flow style example:
host: phl-42
datacentre: { location: philadelphia, cab: 13, cab_unit: 3 }
roles: [ webserver, wp_database ]
